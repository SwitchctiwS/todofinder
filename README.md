#todofinder
Recurses in folder and finds all the different TODO's in a file and outputs every TODO to stdout. If there is a file named 'TODO.txt' in the folder, then it will output that file's contents as well.

###Example
```
<TODO>

</TODO>
```
or
```
<TODO>[...]</TODO>
```

<ul>
<li>CLI with arg module</li>
<li>Recurse ability</li>
<li>Output TODO.txt</li>
</ul>
